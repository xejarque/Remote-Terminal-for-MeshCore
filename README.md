# RemoteTerm for MeshCore

Backend server + browser interface for MeshCore mesh radio networks. Connect your radio over Serial, TCP, or BLE, and then you can:

* Send and receive DMs and channel messages
* Cache all received packets, decrypting as you gain keys
* Run multiple Python bots that can analyze messages and respond to DMs and channels
* Monitor unlimited contacts and channels (radio limits don't apply -- packets are decrypted server-side)
* Access your radio remotely over your network or VPN
* Search for hashtag channel names for channels you don't have keys for yet
* Forward packets to MQTT, LetsMesh, MeshRank, SQS, Apprise, etc.
* Use the more recent 1.14 firmwares which support multibyte pathing
* Visualize the mesh as a map or node set, view repeater stats, and more!

For advanced setup and troubleshooting see [README_ADVANCED.md](README_ADVANCED.md). If you plan to contribute, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Warning:** This app is for trusted environments only. _Do not put this on an untrusted network, or open it to the public._ You can optionally set `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` for app-wide HTTP Basic auth, but that is only a coarse gate and must be paired with HTTPS. The bots can execute arbitrary Python code which means anyone who gets access to the app can, too. To completely disable the bot system, start the server with `MESHCORE_DISABLE_BOTS=true` — this prevents all bot execution and blocks bot configuration changes via the API. If you need stronger access control, consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx, or extending FastAPI; full access control and user management are outside the scope of this app.

> [!WARNING]
> RemoteTerm does *full* management of the radio, meaning that once a radio is connected to RemoteTerm, all contacts/channels will be imported and offloaded to RemoteTerm and the contacts actually synced to the device will be governed by RemoteTerm. This means that RemoteTerm can be a poor fit for users who are looking to swap radios in and out, maintaining radio state (favorites, channels, etc.) irrespective of app usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js LTS or current (20, 22, 24, 25) if you're not using a prebuilt release
- [UV](https://astral.sh/uv) package manager: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- MeshCore radio connected via USB serial, TCP, or BLE

## Install Path 1: Clone And Build

**This approach is recommended over Docker due to intermittent serial communications issues I've seen on \*nix systems.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkingsman/Remote-Terminal-for-MeshCore.git
cd Remote-Terminal-for-MeshCore

uv sync
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Access the app at http://localhost:8000.

Source checkouts expect a normal frontend build in `frontend/dist`.

> [!TIP]
> Running on lightweight hardware, or just do not want to build the frontend locally? From a cloned checkout, run `python3 scripts/setup/fetch_prebuilt_frontend.py` to fetch and unpack a prebuilt frontend into `frontend/prebuilt`, then start the app normally with `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux, you can also install RemoteTerm as a persistent `systemd` service that starts on boot and restarts automatically on failure:
>
> ```bash
> bash scripts/setup/install_service.sh
> ```
>
> For the full service workflow and post-install operations, see [README_ADVANCED.md](README_ADVANCED.md).

## Install Path 2: Docker

> **Warning:** Docker has had reports intermittent issues with serial event subscriptions. The native method above is more reliable.

Local Docker builds are architecture-native by default. On Apple Silicon Macs and ARM64 Linux hosts such as Raspberry Pi, `docker compose build` / `docker compose up --build` will produce an ARM64 image unless you override the platform.

For serial-device passthrough, use rootful Docker. In practice that usually means starting the stack with `sudo docker compose ...` unless your Docker daemon is already configured for rootful access via your user/group. Rootless Docker has been observed to fail on serial-device mappings even when the compose file itself is correct.

Create a local `docker-compose.yml` in one of two ways:

1. Copy the example file and edit it by hand:

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

2. Or generate one interactively:

```bash
bash scripts/setup/install_docker.sh
```

Your local `docker-compose.yml` is gitignored so future pulls do not overwrite your Docker settings.

The guided Docker flow can collect BLE settings, but BLE access from Docker still needs manual compose customization such as Bluetooth passthrough and possibly privileged mode or host networking. If you want the simpler path for BLE, use the regular Python launch flow instead.

Then customize the local compose file for your transport and launch:

```bash
sudo docker compose up # add -d for background once you validate it's working
```

The database is stored in `./data/` (bind-mounted), so the container shares the same database as the native app.

To rebuild after pulling updates:

```bash
sudo docker compose pull
sudo docker compose up -d
```

The example file and setup script default to the published Docker Hub image. To build locally from your checkout instead, replace:

```yaml
image: docker.io/jkingsman/remoteterm-meshcore:latest
```

with:

```yaml
build: .
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

The container runs as root by default for maximum serial passthrough compatibility across host setups. On Linux, if you switch between native and Docker runs, `./data` can end up root-owned. If you do not need that serial compatibility behavior, you can enable the optional `user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"` line in `docker-compose.yml` to keep ownership aligned with your host user.

To stop:

```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

## Install Path 3: Arch Linux (AUR)

A [`remoteterm-meshcore`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/remoteterm-meshcore) package is available in the AUR. Install it with an AUR helper or build it manually:

```bash
# with an AUR helper
yay -S remoteterm-meshcore

# or manually
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/remoteterm-meshcore.git
cd remoteterm-meshcore
makepkg -si
```

Configure your radio connection, then start the service:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/remoteterm-meshcore/remoteterm.env
sudo systemctl enable --now remoteterm-meshcore
```

Access the app at http://localhost:8000.

## Standard Environment Variables

Only one transport may be active at a time. If multiple are set, the server will refuse to start.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MESHCORE_SERIAL_PORT` | (auto-detect) | Serial port path |
| `MESHCORE_SERIAL_BAUDRATE` | 115200 | Serial baud rate |
| `MESHCORE_TCP_HOST` | | TCP host (mutually exclusive with serial/BLE) |
| `MESHCORE_TCP_PORT` | 5000 | TCP port |
| `MESHCORE_BLE_ADDRESS` | | BLE device address (mutually exclusive with serial/TCP) |
| `MESHCORE_BLE_PIN` | | BLE PIN (required when BLE address is set) |
| `MESHCORE_LOG_LEVEL` | INFO | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |
| `MESHCORE_DATABASE_PATH` | `data/meshcore.db` | SQLite database path |
| `MESHCORE_DISABLE_BOTS` | false | Disable bot system entirely (blocks execution and config; an intermediate security precaution, but not as good as basic auth) |
| `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` | | Optional app-wide HTTP Basic auth username; must be set together with `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` |
| `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | | Optional app-wide HTTP Basic auth password; must be set together with `MESHCORE_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` |

Common launch patterns:

```bash
# Serial (explicit port)
MESHCORE_SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# TCP
MESHCORE_TCP_HOST=192.168.1.100 MESHCORE_TCP_PORT=5000 uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# BLE
MESHCORE_BLE_ADDRESS=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF MESHCORE_BLE_PIN=123456 uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

On Windows (PowerShell), set environment variables as a separate statement:

```powershell
$env:MESHCORE_SERIAL_PORT="COM8" # or your COM port
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Windows + MQTT fanout:** Python's default Windows event loop (ProactorEventLoop) is not compatible with the MQTT libraries used by RemoteTerm. If you configure any MQTT integration, add `--loop none` to your uvicorn command:
>
> ```powershell
> uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --loop none
> ```
>
> If you forget, the app will start normally but MQTT connections will fail and you'll see a toast in the UI with this same guidance.

If you enable Basic Auth, protect the app with HTTPS. HTTP Basic credentials are not safe on plain HTTP. Also note that the app's permissive CORS policy is a deliberate trusted-network tradeoff, so cross-origin browser JavaScript is not a reliable way to use that Basic Auth gate.
