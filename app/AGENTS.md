# Backend AGENTS.md

This document is the backend working guide for agents and developers.
Keep it aligned with `app/` source files and router behavior.

## Stack

- FastAPI
- aiosqlite
- Pydantic
- MeshCore Python library (`meshcore` from PyPI)
- PyCryptodome

## Code Ethos

- Prefer strong domain modules over layers of pass-through helpers.
- Split code when the new module owns real policy, not just a nicer name.
- Avoid wrapper services around globals unless they materially improve testability or reduce coupling.
- Keep workflows locally understandable; do not scatter one reasoning unit across several files without a clear contract.
- Typed write/read contracts are preferred over loose dict-shaped repository inputs.

## Core Runtime Flows

### Incoming data

1. Radio emits events.
2. `on_rx_log_data` stores raw packet and tries decrypt/pipeline handling.
3. Shared message-domain services create/update `messages` and shape WS payloads.
4. Direct-message storage is centralized in `services/dm_ingest.py`; packet-processor DMs and `CONTACT_MSG_RECV` fallback events both route through that seam.

### Outgoing messages

1. Send endpoints in `routers/messages.py` validate requests and delegate to `services/message_send.py`.
2. Service-layer send workflows call MeshCore commands, persist outgoing messages, and wire ACK tracking.
3. Endpoint broadcasts WS `message` event so all live clients update.
4. ACK/repeat updates arrive later as `message_acked` events.
5. Channel resend (`POST /messages/channel/{id}/resend`) strips the sender name prefix by exact match against the current radio name. This assumes the radio name hasn't changed between the original send and the resend. Name changes require an explicit radio config update and are rare, but the `new_timestamp=true` resend path has no time window, so a mismatch is possible if the name was changed between the original send and a later resend.

### Connection lifecycle

- `RadioManager.start_connection_monitor()` checks health every 5s.
- `RadioManager.post_connect_setup()` delegates to `services/radio_lifecycle.py`.
- Routers, startup/lifespan code, fanout helpers, and `radio_sync.py` should reach radio state through `services/radio_runtime.py`, not by importing `app.radio.radio_manager` directly.
- Shared reconnect/setup helpers in `services/radio_lifecycle.py` are used by startup, the monitor, and manual reconnect/reboot flows before broadcasting healthy state.
- Setup still includes handler registration, key export, time sync, contact/channel sync, and advertisement tasks. The message-poll task always starts: by default it runs as a low-frequency hourly audit, and `MESHCORE_ENABLE_MESSAGE_POLL_FALLBACK=true` switches it to aggressive 10-second polling. That audit checks both missed-radio-message drift and channel-slot cache drift; cache mismatches are logged, toasted, and the send-slot cache is reset.
- Post-connect setup is timeout-bounded. If initial radio offload/setup hangs too long, the backend logs the failure and broadcasts an `error` toast telling the operator to reboot the radio and restart the server.

## Important Behaviors

### Multibyte routing

- Packet `path_len` values are hop counts, not byte counts.
- Hop width comes from the packet or radio `path_hash_mode`: `0` = 1-byte, `1` = 2-byte, `2` = 3-byte.
- Channel slot count comes from firmware-reported `DEVICE_INFO.max_channels`; do not hardcode `40` when scanning/offloading channel slots.
- Channel sends use a session-local LRU slot cache after startup channel offload clears the radio. Repeated sends to the same room reuse the loaded slot; new rooms fill free slots up to the discovered channel capacity, then evict the least recently used cached room.
- TCP radios do not reuse cached slot contents. For TCP, channel sends still force `set_channel(...)` before every send because this backend does not have exclusive device access.
- `MESHCORE_FORCE_CHANNEL_SLOT_RECONFIGURE=true` disables slot reuse on all transports and forces the old always-`set_channel(...)` behavior before every channel send.
- Contacts persist canonical direct-route fields (`direct_path`, `direct_path_len`, `direct_path_hash_mode`) so contact sync and outbound DM routing reuse the exact stored hop width instead of inferring from path bytes.
- Direct-route sources are limited to radio contact sync (`out_path`) and PATH/path-discovery updates. This mirrors firmware `onContactPathRecv(...)`, which replaces `ContactInfo.out_path` when a new returned path is heard.
- `route_override_path`, `route_override_len`, and `route_override_hash_mode` take precedence over the learned direct route for radio-bound sends.
- Advertisement paths are stored only in `contact_advert_paths` for analytics/visualization. They are not part of `Contact.to_radio_dict()` or DM route selection.
- `contact_advert_paths` identity is `(public_key, path_hex, path_len)` because the same hex bytes can represent different routes at different hop widths.

### Read/unread state

- Server is source of truth (`contacts.last_read_at`, `channels.last_read_at`).
- `GET /api/read-state/unreads` returns counts, mention flags, and `last_message_times`.

### DM ingest + ACKs

- `services/dm_ingest.py` is the one place that should decide fallback-context resolution, DM dedup/reconciliation, and packet-linked vs. content-based storage behavior.
- `CONTACT_MSG_RECV` is a fallback path, not a parallel source of truth. If you change DM storage behavior, trace both `event_handlers.py` and `packet_processor.py`.
- DM ACK tracking is an in-memory pending/buffered map in `services/dm_ack_tracker.py`, with periodic expiry from `radio_sync.py`.
- Outgoing DMs send once inline, store/broadcast immediately after the first successful `MSG_SENT`, then may retry up to 2 more times in the background if still unacked.
- DM retry timing follows the firmware-provided `suggested_timeout` from `PACKET_MSG_SENT`; do not replace it with a fixed app timeout unless you intentionally want more aggressive duplicate-prone retries.
- Direct-message send behavior is intended to emulate `meshcore_py.commands.send_msg_with_retry(...)`: stage the effective contact route on the radio, send, wait for ACK, and on the final retry force flood via `reset_path(...)`.
- Non-final DM attempts use the contact's effective route (`override > direct > flood`). The final retry is intentionally sent as flood even when a routing override exists.
- DM ACK state is terminal on first ACK. Retry attempts may register multiple expected ACK codes for the same message, but sibling pending codes are cleared once one ACK wins so a DM should not accrue multiple delivery confirmations from retries.
- ACKs are delivery state, not routing state. Bundled ACKs inside PATH packets still satisfy pending DM sends, but ACK history does not feed contact route learning.

### Echo/repeat dedup

- Message uniqueness: `(type, conversation_key, text, sender_timestamp)`.
- Duplicate insert is treated as an echo/repeat: the new path (if any) is appended, and the ACK count is incremented only for outgoing channel messages. Incoming direct messages with the same conversation/text/sender timestamp also collapse onto one stored row, with later observations merging path data instead of creating a second DM.

### Raw packet dedup policy

- Raw packet storage deduplicates by payload hash (`RawPacketRepository.create`), excluding routing/path bytes.
- Stored packet `id` is therefore a payload identity, not a per-arrival identity.
- Realtime raw-packet WS broadcasts include `observation_id` (unique per RF arrival) in addition to `id`.
- Frontend packet-feed features should key/dedupe by `observation_id`; use `id` only as the storage reference.
- Message-layer repeat handling (`_handle_duplicate_message` + `MessageRepository.add_path`) is separate from raw-packet storage dedup.

### Contact sync throttle

- `sync_recent_contacts_to_radio()` sets `_last_contact_sync = now` before the sync completes.
- This is intentional: if sync fails, the next attempt is still throttled to prevent a retry-storm against a flaky radio. Contacts will resync on the next scheduled cycle or on reconnect.

### Periodic advertisement

- Controlled by `app_settings.advert_interval` (seconds).
- `0` means disabled.
- Last send time tracked in `app_settings.last_advert_time`.

### Fanout bus

- All external integrations (MQTT, bots, webhooks, Apprise, SQS) are managed through the fanout bus (`app/fanout/`).
- Configs stored in `fanout_configs` table, managed via `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/fanout`.
- `broadcast_event()` in `websocket.py` dispatches to the fanout manager for `message` and `raw_packet` events.
- Each integration is a `FanoutModule` with scope-based filtering.
- Community MQTT publishes raw packets only, but its derived `path` field for direct packets is emitted as comma-separated hop identifiers, not flat path bytes.
- See `app/fanout/AGENTS_fanout.md` for full architecture details.

## WebSocket Events

- `health` — radio connection status (broadcast on change, personal on connect)
- `contact` — single contact upsert (from advertisements and radio sync)
- `contact_resolved` — prefix contact reconciled to a full contact row (payload: `{ previous_public_key, contact }`)
- `message` — new message (channel or DM, from packet processor or send endpoints)
- `message_acked` — ACK/echo update for existing message (ack count + paths)
- `raw_packet` — every incoming RF packet (for real-time packet feed UI)
- `contact_deleted` — contact removed from database (payload: `{ public_key }`)
- `channel` — single channel upsert/update (payload: full `Channel`)
- `channel_deleted` — channel removed from database (payload: `{ key }`)
- `error` — toast notification (reconnect failure, missing private key, stuck radio startup, etc.)
- `success` — toast notification (historical decrypt complete, etc.)

Backend WS sends go through typed serialization in `events.py`. Initial WS connect sends `health` only. Contacts/channels are loaded by REST.
Client sends `"ping"` text; server replies `{"type":"pong"}`.

## Data Model Notes

Main tables:
- `contacts` (includes `first_seen` for contact age tracking and `direct_path_hash_mode` / `route_override_*` for DM routing)
- `channels`
  Includes optional `flood_scope_override` for channel-specific regional sends.
- `messages` (includes `sender_name`, `sender_key` for per-contact channel message attribution)
- `raw_packets`
- `contact_advert_paths` (recent unique advertisement paths per contact, keyed by contact + path bytes + hop count)
- `contact_name_history` (tracks name changes over time)
- `app_settings`

Contact route state is canonicalized on the backend:
- stored route inputs: `direct_path`, `direct_path_len`, `direct_path_hash_mode`, `direct_path_updated_at`, plus optional `route_override_*`
- computed route surface: `effective_route`, `effective_route_source`, `direct_route`, `route_override`
- removed legacy names: `last_path`, `last_path_len`, `out_path_hash_mode`

Frontend and send paths should consume the canonical route surface rather than reconstructing precedence from raw fields.

Repository writes should prefer typed models such as `ContactUpsert` over ad hoc dict payloads when adding or updating schema-coupled data.

`max_radio_contacts` is the configured radio contact capacity baseline. Favorites reload first, the app refills non-favorite working-set contacts to about 80% of that capacity, and periodic offload triggers once occupancy reaches about 95%.

`app_settings` fields in active model:
- `max_radio_contacts`
- `favorites`
- `auto_decrypt_dm_on_advert`
- `sidebar_sort_order`
- `last_message_times`
- `preferences_migrated`
- `advert_interval`
- `last_advert_time`
- `flood_scope`
- `blocked_keys`, `blocked_names`

Note: `sidebar_sort_order` remains in the backend model for compatibility and migration, but the current frontend sidebar uses per-section localStorage sort preferences instead of a single shared server-backed sort mode.

Note: MQTT, community MQTT, and bot configs were migrated to the `fanout_configs` table (migrations 36-38).

## Security Posture (intentional)

- No per-user authn/authz model; optionally, operators may enable app-wide HTTP Basic auth for both HTTP and WS entrypoints.
- No CORS restriction (`*`).
- Bot code executes user-provided Python via `exec()`.

These are product decisions for trusted-network deployments; do not flag as accidental vulnerabilities.

## Errata & Known Non-Issues

### Sender timestamps are 1-second resolution (protocol constraint)

The MeshCore radio protocol encodes `sender_timestamp` as a 4-byte little-endian integer (Unix seconds). This is a firmware-level wire format — the radio, the Python library (`commands/messaging.py`), and the decoder (`decoder.py`) all read/write exactly 4 bytes. Millisecond Unix timestamps would overflow 4 bytes, so higher resolution is not possible without a firmware change.

**Consequence:** Message dedup still operates at 1-second granularity because the radio protocol only provides second-resolution `sender_timestamp`. Do not attempt to fix this by switching to millisecond timestamps — it will break echo dedup (the echo's 4-byte timestamp won't match the stored value) and overflow `to_bytes(4, "little")`. Incoming DMs now share the same second-resolution content identity tradeoff as channel echoes: same-contact same-text same-second observations collapse onto one stored row.

### Outgoing DM echoes remain undecrypted

When our own outgoing DM is heard back via `RX_LOG_DATA` (self-echo, loopback), `_process_direct_message` passes `our_public_key=None` for the outgoing direction, disabling the outbound hash check in the decoder. The decoder's inbound check (`src_hash == their_first_byte`) fails because the source is us, not the contact — so decryption returns `None`. This is by design: outgoing DMs are stored directly by the send endpoint, so no message is lost.

### Infinite setup retry on connection monitor

When `post_connect_setup()` fails (e.g. `export_and_store_private_key` raises `RuntimeError` because the radio didn't respond), `_setup_complete` is never set to `True`. The connection monitor sees `connected and not setup_complete` and retries every 5 seconds — indefinitely. This is intentional: the radio may be rebooting, waking from sleep, or otherwise temporarily unresponsive. We keep retrying so that setup completes automatically once the radio becomes available, without requiring manual intervention.

### DELETE channel returns 200 for non-existent keys

`DELETE /api/channels/{key}` returns `{"status": "ok"}` even if the key didn't exist. This is intentional — the postcondition is "channel doesn't exist," which is satisfied regardless of whether it existed before. No 404 needed.

### Contact lat/lon 0.0 vs NULL

MeshCore uses `0.0` as the sentinel for "no GPS coordinates" (see `models.py` `to_radio_dict`). The upsert SQL uses `COALESCE(excluded.lat, contacts.lat)`, which preserves existing values when the new value is `NULL` — but `0.0` is not `NULL`, so it overwrites previously valid coordinates. This is intentional: we always want the most recent location data. If a device stops broadcasting GPS, the old coordinates are presumably stale/wrong, so overwriting with "not available" (`0.0`) is the correct behavior.

## Editing Checklist

When changing backend behavior:
1. Update/add router and repository tests.
2. Confirm WS event contracts when payload shape changes.
3. Run `PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/ -v`.
4. If API contract changed, update frontend types and AGENTS docs.
